1. Created an S3 bucket with public access.

2. Upload the code to the bucket.
{
      "Statement": [
            {
                  "Side": "PublicReadForGetBucketObjects":
                  "Effect: "Allow",
                  "Principal": "*",
                  "Action": "s3:GetObject",
                  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::chxtan/*"
            }
      ]
}


3. Host it by enabling, “Static Website Hosting”.

4. Give access to the objects that are in the S3 bucket, by editing “Bucket Policy”.

5. It will generate a link to access the static website.

6. Using Route53, we can connect it to a specific domain name.
